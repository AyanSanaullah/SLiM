write a 100 word story about a car
The '57 Chevy, nicknamed "Cherry Bomb," was a legend. Old Man Hemlock had bought it new, kept it pristine. Rumors whispered of a hidden compartment in the glove box, holding a fortune. Kids dared each other to touch it. One day, Hemlock was gone. The Chevy sat, untouched. Finally, his niece inherited it. A young woman, practical, she sold it. The new owner, a mechanic, tore it apart. No fortune. Just a faded photograph tucked in the glove box: Hemlock, young and laughing, leaning against his Cherry Bomb. The real treasure, it seemed, was the memory.
